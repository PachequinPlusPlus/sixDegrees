Trying to test the theory of six degrees of distance

Considering using one of the next sources:

Twitter : Limits followers requests for 15 Requests / 15 Min

Facebook : I think there is not really API for friends

Instagram : Same as FB, I dont think there's a lot of flexibility for the followers, might be possible to get them while using
            some kind of browser parsers, but that might be really slow


Ideally I'd like to work with Instagram because of its popularity but it's limited
Twitter could be really useful with some considerations
